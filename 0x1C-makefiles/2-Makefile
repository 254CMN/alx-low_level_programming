# First useful makefile
# You are not allowed to have a list of .o files i.e 'OBJ = main.o school.o
# Hence, in variable OBJ, assign : OBJ = $(SRC:%.c=%.o)
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c 
OBJ = $(SRC:%.c=%.o) # This is to say that variable SRC containing files , all .c files will be replaced with .o files 
NAME = school

all : $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)
